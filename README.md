# Brick Breaker on a FPGA

This project contains the working game "Brick Breaker". The bottom of the screen has a moving platform that the ball can bounce off, and the ball then bounces up and can angle bounce off the sides of the game or directly onto the bricks, slowly breaking them. The goal of the game is to break all the bricks. This game was implemented in verilog and C for an FPGA board.
